multicore/remoteproc/readme.txt

The remoteproc Linux framework allows different platforms/architectures to
control (power on, load firmware, power off) remote processors (from the Linux 
perspective) while abstracting the hardware differences.
This folder contains basic source code used for remote core applications to allow 
their easy deployment/start/debug via the remoteproc Linux framework.
