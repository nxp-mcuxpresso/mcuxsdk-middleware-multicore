# MCSDK demo applications

Multicore and multiprocessor example applications are stored together with other MCUXpresso SDK examples, in the dedicated multicore subfolder.

|Location|Folder|
|--------|------|
|Multicore example projects|<MCUXpressoSDK\_install\_dir\>/boards/<board\_name\>/ multicore\_examples/<application\_name\>/<core\_type\>/ <toolchain\>|
|Multiprocessor example projects|<MCUXpressoSDK\_install\_dir\>/boards/<board\_name\>/ multiprocessor\_examples/<application\_name\>/<core\_type\>/ <toolchain\>|

See the *Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK* \(document MCUXSDKGSUG\) and *Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for XXX Derivatives*documents for more information about the MCUXpresso SDK example folder structure and the location of individual files that form the example application projects. These documents also contain information about building, running, and debugging multicore demo applications in individual supported IDEs. Each example application also contains a readme file that describes the operation of the example and required setup steps.
